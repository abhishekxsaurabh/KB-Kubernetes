Create Custom Scheduler Rather to use Default Scheduler. 

cd /etc/kubernetes/manifest/
cat kube-scheduler
copy all content of kube-scheduler and paste into a new file “my-scheduler.yaml”.
vi my-scheduler.yaml
netstat -taulpn | grep 10259 
Choose any random port to use with the scheduler. 
netstat -tulpn | grep 10282
Change the Host Port also. 
Now create a scheduler pod	# kubectl apply -f my-scheduler.yaml
Validate the pod		# kubectl get pod
Now launch a new pod and check which scheduler are used by same pod or different pod.
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
verify by which schedule the said pod was launched. 
kubectl describe pod mypod
